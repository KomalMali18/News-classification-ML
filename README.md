📰 News Classification using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

This project classifies news articles into different categories using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
It analyzes the title and body of news articles to predict their category (e.g., sports, business, politics, etc.).

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (for ML models)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)

CSV (for dataset storage)
